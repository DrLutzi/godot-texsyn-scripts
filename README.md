This project is a script repository to test our texture synthesis scripts and image processing classes using [our fork of Godot 4.0](https://github.com/DrLutzi/godot), in the [texsyn4 branch](https://github.com/DrLutzi/godot/tree/texsyn4).
It is used by researchers at the BISOUS of the University of Sherbrooke to work on real-time texture synthesis.
It contains direct implementations of **cyclostationary tiling and blending** [[LSD21]](LSD21), **autocovariance-preserving tiling and blending** [[LSD23]](LSD23) and all tiling and blending algorithms are designed using a **square/square dual tiling structure** [[LSD23]](LSD23).

## Installation

- Get [our fork of Godot 4.0](https://github.com/DrLutzi/godot), which has the same requirements as Godot 4.
- Switch to the *texsyn4* branch and execute ``git submodule update --init`` to get the [Eigen library](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen).
- Compile godot (see [compiling godot from source](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/index.html))
- Download the resources and texsyn files of [this drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i5tzNFtTbG-DTTWhwVybwerXT3g1NZnn?usp=sharing) and paste them into the repository. It contains some pre-computed files for a basic demo.
If you do not do that, you will need to re-create a new scene file (refer to section [Custom scene](#custom-scene))
- Execute the godot editor using this repository as working folder, or with the project selection screen.

## Custom scene

### Creating a stationary tiling and blending surface.

To create a surface with a stationary tiling and blending using 2 square tilings [[LSD23]](LSD23):

- Create any MeshInstance3D with its geometry (for instance, a plane)
- In its Material, attach [shaders/texsyn_stationary_pbr.gdshader](shaders/texsyn_stationary_pbr.gdshader)
- Add any texture component you want in the shader parameters.
- [Set the shader parameters](setting-the-shader-parameters)

### Creating an autocovariance-preserving tiling and blending surface.

To create a surface with an autocovariance-preserving tiling and blending [[LSD23]](LSD23) using 2 square tilings :

- Create any node
- Attach the script [scripts/texsyn_autocovariance_computer.gd](scripts/texsyn_autocovariance_computer.gd) to the node
- Set the textures you want for your surface in the script parameters.
- Set the size of the probability density function computed (Pdf size). Since the pdf is the autocovariance function, the latter needs to be computed, and the computation time increases quadratically with respect to the size of the textures. 256 is a good default size if you are in a hurry.
- Execute the scene once. The script will take several minutes to compute the autocovariance-preserving mean textures as well as a realization of the sampler. It will be executed whenever the corresponding means and sampler realization are not found.
- Create any MeshInstance3D with its geometry (for instance, a plane)
- In its Material, attach [shaders/texsyn_cyclostationary_pbr.gdshader](shaders/texsyn_cyclostationary_pbr.gdshader).
- Add your texture components, their respective mean, and the realization of the sampler in the appropriate shader parameters.
- [Set the shader parameters](setting-the-shader-parameters)

### Creating a cyclostationary tiling and blending surface.

To create a surface with a cyclostationary tiling and blending (for textures whose elements have a periodic global organisation [[LSD21]](LSD21) using 2 square tilings: 
- Create any node
- Attach the script [scripts/texsyn_cyclostationary_computer.gd](scripts/texsyn_cyclostationary_computer.gd) to the node
- Set the textures you want for your surface in the script parameters.
- Set the First Period Vector and Second Period Vector values in the script parameters. See [Cyclostationarity: Period vectors](cyclostationarity-choosing-period-vectors). 
- Execute the scene once. The script will take several minutes to compute the cyclostationary mean textures, required for cyclostationary texture synthesis, as well as a realization of the cyclostationary sampler. It will be executed whenever the corresponding means and sampler realization are not found.
- Create any MeshInstance3D with its geometry (for instance, a plane)
- In its Material, attach [shaders/texsyn_cyclostationary_pbr.gdshader](shaders/texsyn_cyclostationary_pbr.gdshader).
- Add your texture components, their respective mean, and the realization of the sampler in the appropriate shader parameters.
- [Set the shader parameters](setting-the-shader-parameters)

### Setting the shader parameters.
Each shader was written by first generating the code of a StandardMaterial3D. As such, some parameters are not correct by default.
Assuming every texture component is set, in order to get the classic default parameters, from top to bottom, you need to:
- Set **Albedo** to a white color
- Set **Roughness** to 1
- Set **Metallic Texture Channel** to (1, 0, 0, 0) assuming the metallic map is on the red component
- Set **Specular** to 0.5
- Set **Metallic** to 1
- Set **Normal Scale** to 1
- Set **AO Texture Channel** to (1, 0, 0, 0) assuming the AO map is on the red component
- Set **Heightmap Scale** to 1
- Set **Heightmap Min Layers** to 8
- Set **Heightmap Max Layers** to 32
- Set **UV1 Scale** to (1, 1, 1) (although you probably want to test out a large scale since you're here)
- If not already done, set each texture, and, for cyclostationarity, the realization of the sampler, and each spatially-varying mean.

3. Optionnal: Camera

We borrowed a [simple script for the camera](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1561), you can attach that to a Camera3D to move in your scene when you execute it.

NOTE: Only seamless textures are compatible.

## Cyclostationarity: choosing period vectors.

When wanting to display a surface with a cyclostationary texture synthesis [[LSD21]](LSD21), you need to tell the sampler how it should blend the elements of the texture.
To do this, you need to set First Period Vector and Second Period Vector, with values between 0 and 1 for each component. 
These represents the different translation vectors needed to get from one element of the pattern to another. 
For ease of use, you can also **give instead the inverse vector values**. 
Here are the two most typical cases: 
- The elements of your texture are **orthogonal**, that is, organized in a `NxM` grid: set the periods to `(N, 0)` and `(0, M)`. 
- The texture is a **brick wall-like** texture (alternating pattern) with `N` bricks on `x` and `M` bricks on `y`: set the period vectors to `(N, 0)` and `(2N, M)`. This is because getting to the next closest element on y requires to draw a diagonal vector.
